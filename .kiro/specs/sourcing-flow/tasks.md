# Implementation Plan: Sourcing Flow (Procure-to-Pay)

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the sourcing flow feature into discrete coding tasks.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties using Hypothesis library
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- All property tests should run with minimum 100 iterations
- Database migrations should be created before implementing services
- Transaction Engine should be implemented first as it's used by multiple components
- Integration with existing APIs (Suppliers, Purchase Receipt, Invoice, Payment) should use wrapper services
