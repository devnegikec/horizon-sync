## Debug Changelog - Test Validation Issue

### Session ID: 20260125_051316_378372

### Problem
Test at line 45 in `ForgotPasswordForm.spec.tsx` failing - `waitFor` not catching validation error for invalid email.

### Root Cause
HTML5's built-in email validation was preventing form submission (firing `invalid` event), which blocked React Hook Form's validation from ever running. This is a common issue when using React Hook Form with HTML5 input types like `type="email"`.

### Solution Applied
Added `noValidate` attribute to the form element to disable HTML5 validation and rely entirely on React Hook Form's validation via Zod schema.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added noValidate to form element (PERMANENT FIX)
- **File:** `apps/platform/src/app/components/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx`
- **Change:** Added `noValidate` attribute to form element at line 72
- **Lines:** 72
- **Reason:** Disables HTML5 validation so React Hook Form can handle all validation
- **Revert:** Remove `noValidate` attribute from the form element

#### 2. Updated test to use userEvent instead of fireEvent
- **File:** `apps/platform/src/test/app/components/ForgotPasswordForm.spec.tsx`
- **Change:** Replaced `fireEvent.change` and `fireEvent.click` with `userEvent.type` and `userEvent.click`
- **Lines:** 45-55
- **Reason:** userEvent provides more realistic user interaction and properly waits for React updates
- **Revert:** 
  ```typescript
  // Replace lines 45-55 with original:
  it('2. should show validation error for invalid email', async () => {
    renderForm();
    
    const emailInput = screen.getByLabelText(/email address/i);
    fireEvent.change(emailInput, { target: { value: 'invalid-email' } });
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /send reset link/i }));

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText(/please enter a valid email address/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
  ```

### Test Results
✅ All 5 tests passing after applying the fix

### Debugging Steps Taken
1. Added logging to component and test to trace validation flow
2. Discovered HTML5 validation was firing `invalid` event
3. Confirmed form `onSubmit` was never called due to HTML5 blocking
4. Applied `noValidate` fix as standard practice for React Hook Form

## Revert Status
- [ ] Change 1 - noValidate attribute
- [ ] Change 2 - userEvent update in test
